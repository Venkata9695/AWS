Getting started with Jenkins
The Jenkins project produces two release lines, LTS and weekly. Depending on your organization's needs, one may be preferred over the other.

Both release lines are distributed as .war files, native packages, installers, and Docker containers. Packages with the  gear icon are maintained by third parties.

Long-term Support (LTS)
LTS (Long-Term Support) releases are chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period. Learn moreâ€¦
